I am happy to announce the second annual SpookyJam! This is a mod making event that is set to take place on the first two weeks of October. Participants in this event are encouraged to create mods that have a spooky/dark/mysterious theme, however fall/autumn or any other seasonally relevant theme can be used. 

Unlike similar events, SpookyJam is a non-competitive event. The focus of the event is learning new things, challenging yourself, and encouraging the creation of new content. At the end of the event we will release a modpack to showcase the submissions. This pack may also be put on a public server where people can play with the mods and experience them together for a limited time. Participants and those following the event should use the `#SpookyJamMC` tag on twitter to talk about the event. We will be using this tag to share updates, and to help us find things to retweet.

## Guidelines

The following list of guidelines are in place to provide a fair experience for everyone. Not following these guidelines may result in your project being excluded from various rewards and/or promotions.

1. Submissions should make use of the seasonal theme of the event.
2. Teams should not be larger than four members.
3. Submissions should be made within the time frame of the event.
4. All submissions should be able to run on a server without crashing it.
5. All assets and code should be created during the event. Open sourced assets that were made before the event are allowed.
6. Any open source libraries are allowed. Participants are responsible for any issues their required libraries cause.
7. Submissions should work with Minecraft 1.12.2, and the latest version of Forge and stable MCP for 1.12.2.
8. You may submit multiple entries, or participate on multiple teams.
9. Mod generators such as MCreator are not allowed. Tools which generate pieces of code such as IDE tools or some modeling programs are fine.
10. Submissions should be visible source.

Please note that time zones for this event are somewhat loose. The event officially starts when the first time zone enters October 1st, and will officially end when the last time zone enters the 15th.

## Rewards

We will be giving out prizes as part of this event. Five participants will be randomly chosen to receive a 200 curse point prize. To be eligible for this prize pool, you must submit a mod that follows the guidelines or be part of a team that has. Event organizers and sponsors are not eligible to win, but are still allowed to participate in the event. Prizes will be given to random individual participants, and not to a specific team or project. This means that being on multiple teams or submitting multiple projects will not affect your chances of winning. Each participant is only allowed to be selected once, meaning that a participant can only win one of the prizes.

If you do not want to be eligible for winning one of the prizes, you can ask a team member (preferably Darkhax) to remove your name from the draw. If the winner of a prize declines, or does not accept it within a week, another participant who is eligible will be randomly chose.

## Submissions

Submissions can be made by leaving a comment on [this](https://gist.github.com/darkhax/a8c619d2597383e47166f98dbb98616b) page with the requested info. Submissions must be made before the end of the 14th of October. Please try to only submit one version of your mod to help avoid confusion and additional work. Once your submission has been reviewed we will update the list of submissions to include your entry.

Please check our Discord for further announcements and discussion.
