	<p>
		SpookyJam is an annual Minecraft mod jam that takes place every fall. We
		invite the community to celebrate the fall season with us by creating
		mods that are spooky, mysterious, or give off autumn vibes. We encourage
		participants to collaborate, learn new skills, and challenge themselves.
		Throughout the event we also host community events such as a public
		server that allows everyone to join and test out the submissions with
		their friends and the rest of the community.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our most recent event was SpookyJam 2022. This event has concluded and
		you can view all the submissions <a href="/events/2022">here</a>. We
		also recommend joining the <a href={DISCORD}>Discord</a> server to keep up
		with the latest news and conversation surrounding the event.
