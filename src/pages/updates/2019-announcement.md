I am happy to announce the third annual SpookyJam event! SpookyJam is our fall celebration for the modded minecraft community. During SpookyJam mod developers create mods that have a spooky, dark, or mysterious theme to them. Mods that fit the fall, autumn, or any other seasonally relevant theme are also invited to participate.

Unlike similar modding events SpookyJam is non-competitive. The focus of SpookyJam is learning new things, challenging yourself, and encouraging the creation of new content. As part of the event we will release a modpack to showcase participating mods. The pack will also be hosted on our event server which will be open to the public to play on. 

Participants and those following the event should use our Discord and the `#SpookyJamMC` tag on twitter to talk about the event. We will be using this tag to share updates and promote posts made by participants during the event.

## Guidelines

The following list of guidelines are in place to provide a fair experience for everyone. While these guidelines are not strictly enforced, choosing not to follow them may result in your project being excluded from certain parts of the event.

1. Submissions should be created between the 1st of October and the 31st of October.
2. Teams are allowed. We recommend keeping to four members.
3. Submissions should follow the general theme of SpookyJam.
4. All assets and code should be created during the event.
5. Submissions should run in a server environment without crashing.
6. Submissions should work with Minecraft 1.14.4 and be compatible with the latest release of Forge and MCP.
7. You may use any library or dependency you want, but you are responsible for issues caused by those dependencies.
8. You must own or have permission to use all code and assets used by your submission. This means tools like MCreator are not allowed.

Time zones for this event will be counted in the most flexible way. This means that the event will start when the first time zone enters October 1st, and will end when the last time zone exits October 31st.

## Prizes & Rewards

All participants who make a valid submission will receive a `SpookyJam2019` role on Discord. This role is purely visual and meant to commemorate the event. Nodecraft has also generously contributed several month long server subscription plans that will be given out randomly to eligible participants after the event is over.

We also encourage everyone participating in SpookyJam to consider taking part in Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest challenge. They will be giving out limited edition shirts and stickers to those who complete pull requests. Opening pull requests against any open source project on GitHub, including mods and other SpookyJam submissions does contribute towards their challenge goal. This event is not just for developers! Artists and translators can also participate. 

## Submissions

Submissions can be made by leaving a comment [here](https://gist.github.com/Darkhax/343c4ffd1eb0bdcd5b37c4b6fd86e744) with the required info. Submissions should be made before the 21st of October to ensure they make it into the server and modpack. Please only submit one version of your submission, we will update them as needed. This same submission page can be used for previous year submissions.

## FaQ

**Can I be part of multiple teams?**
Yes, you may be part of multiple teams.

**Can I submit multiple entires?**
Yes, however spammed entries which are of very low quality may not be considered for the event.

**Can I use Fabric, Forge 1.12, or Bedrock edition?**
While this is technically allowed, we ill not be considering entries other than those that support Forge 1.14.4 for our modpacks and promotion.

**Do open source contributions count as team members?**
No, the team member limit only counts people who are actively part of your team.

**Can we have more than four team members?**
The recommended team limit was put in place to help newer modders join teams. We will not be enforce this as a rule however we recommend teaming up with people you haven't worked with before.

**Why are there no monetary rewards?**
In the past we gave out $10 USD in Curse points to random participants of the event. Due to changed in Curse's policy on transferring points we are no longer able to do this. We have considered alternatives such as PayPal, gift cards, stickers, shirts, and buttons however they were all out of our budget for this event. We may consider these for future events.

**I need help coming up with an idea!**
Learning how to improve your own creativity is part of Spooky Jam's goal. Everyone has their own creative process and this is generally something you have to learn yourself. A few things which may help with inspiration is [/r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/), [/r/TwoSentenceHorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/), [Cryptid Wiki](https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Cryptids), [Terror.ca's random horror movie picker](https://terror.ca/movies/random), [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween), and [Autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn).
