Hello everyone o/

I am happy to announce SpookyJam! This is a mod making event that is set to take place on the first week of October. As the name implies, participants are encouraged to make spooky/dark/mysterious mods, however fall/autumn and other relevant seasonal themes can also be used. Unlike similar events, SpookyJam will be a non-competitive event. The focus on the event is learning new things, challenging yourself, and encouraging the creation of new content. Because of this there will be no voting, judges, or strongly enforced rules. If we receive enough stable submissions, we would like to showcase the submissions as part of a modpack and potentially throw it on a public server for a short time.    

The following is a list of guidelines. These are all optional, however it is strongly encouraged that you follow them to create the best experience for everyone.

1. Mods should make use of the seasonal theme for the event.
2. Teams shouldn't be larger than four team members.
3. Mods should be made open source, and published on GitHub.
4. Mods should be made within the 1 week time frame.
5. Mods should work on both the client and server.
6. All assets, including sounds, textures, and code should be created during the event. Open sourced assets from before the event are allowed.
7. Any and all libraries are allowed.
8. The `#SpookyJamMC` hashtag should be used when talking about this event on Twitter.
