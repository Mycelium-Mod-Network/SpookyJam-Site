        Over the years we have received many submissions from a wide range of
        talented community members! So far we have received exactly {
            submissions.length
        } mod submissions from {allAuthors.size} different authors! SpookyJam mods
        have cumulatively been downloaded {sum.toLocaleString("en-US")} times on
        CurseForge! Below you will find a complete list of every project submitted
        to SpookyJam so far!
