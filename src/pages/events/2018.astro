    <h2>Announcement</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone o/</p>
    <p>
        I am happy to announce the second annual SpookyJam! This is a mod making
        event that is set to take place on the first two weeks of October.
        Participants in this event are encouraged to create mods that have a
        spooky/dark/mysterious theme, however fall/autumn or any other
        seasonally relevant theme can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike similar events, SpookyJam is a non-competitive event. The focus
        of the event is learning new things, challenging yourself, and
        encouraging the creation of new content. At the end of the event we will
        release a modpack to showcase the submissions. This pack may also be put
        on a public server where people can play with the mods and experience
        them together for a limited time. Participants and those following the
        event should use the <a
            href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SpookyJamMC&src=typed_query&f=live"
            target="_blank">#SpookyJamMC</a
        > tag on twitter to talk about the event. We will be using this tag to share
        updates, and to help us find things to retweet.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
        The following list of guidelines are in place to provide a fair
        experience for everyone. Not following these guidelines may result in
        your project being excluded from various rewards and/or promotions.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Submissions should make use of the seasonal theme of the event.</li>
        <li>Teams should not be larger than four members.</li>
        <li>Submissions should be made within the time frame of the event.</li>
        <li>
            All submissions should be able to run on a server without crashing
            it.
        </li>
        <li>
            All assets and code should be created during the event. Open sourced
            assets that were made before the event are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any open source libraries are allowed. Participants are responsible
            for any issues their required libraries cause.
        </li>
        <li>
            Submissions should work with Minecraft 1.12.2, and the latest
            version of Forge and stable MCP for 1.12.2.

        </li>
        <li>
            Mod generators such as MCreator are not allowed. Tools which
            generate pieces of code such as IDE tools or some modeling programs
            are fine.
        </li>
        <li>Submissions should be visible source.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Please note that time zones for this event are somewhat loose. The event
        officially starts when the first time zone enters October 1st, and will
        officially end when the last time zone enters the 15th.
    </p>

    <h2>Prizes & Rewards</h2>
    <p>
        We will be giving out prizes as part of this event. Five participants
        will be randomly chosen to receive a 200 curse point prize. To be
        eligible for this prize pool, you must submit a mod that follows the
        guidelines or be part of a team that has. Event organizers and sponsors
        are not eligible to win, but are still allowed to participate in the
        event. Prizes will be given to random individual participants, and not
        to a specific team or project. This means that being on multiple teams
        or submitting multiple projects will not affect your chances of winning.
        Each participant is only allowed to be selected once, meaning that a
        participant can only win one of the prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to be eligible for winning one of the prizes, you can
        ask a team member (preferably Darkhax) to remove your name from the
        draw. If the winner of a prize declines, or does not accept it within a
        week, another participant who is eligible will be randomly chose.
    </p>
