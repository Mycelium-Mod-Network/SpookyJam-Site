<Layout title="SpookyJam 2023" description="Celebrate the fall season with the modded Minecraft community! SpookyJam 2023 will be taking place September 20th to October 31st!">

    <p>
        SpookyJam is upon us once again! Join us in celebrating the fall season and the modded Minecraft community with
        our seventh annual SpookyJam event! During SpookyJam we encourage mod developers to create new mods that fit
        with the fall season. Those who participate are encouraged to challenge themselves, learn new skills, and
        collaborate to create something awesome for the whole community to enjoy. In addition to the mod jam we also
        host a public server where anyone can join and test out the submissions with the community.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are not a mod developer there are still many ways you can participate in the event! The easiest way to
        participate is to share ideas and give feedback to the participants. While it may not seem like much, a bit of
        encouragement from players can go a long way. Participating in the event yourself may also be easier than you
        think! Join our <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a> for more info.
    </p>

        <p>
            SpookyJam 2023 has officially started! You may now start working on your entries. You will have until the
            end of October to submit your entry. We recommend submitting your entries as soon as possible so players can
            have time to enjoy your mods. If you have any questions or want to track progress we recommend joining our
            <a href={DISCORD}>Discord</a> server.
        </p>
    </Timer>

    <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

    <p>
        The following rules have been put in place to ensure a safe and fair experience for all participants. Breaking
        these rules may result in your submission being disqualified. If you have any questions about the rules please
        reach out on our <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a>.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Submissions must only be developed during the event period. This year the event starts on September 20th and
            will end on October 31st. Coming up with ideas in advance is fine, however all code, textures, sounds,
            models, and other assets must be made during the event period. A special exception is given for public
            domain and CC0 assets that are available to everyone. You may also use and remix official Mojang assets
            provided that your use is lawful, fair use, or abides with Mojang's terms and conditions.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must fit with the themes of SpookyJam. These themes include anything that is spooky, dark, or
            mysterious. Anything that fits with the fall/autumn season or celebrates a seasonally relevant custom or
            tradition is also allowed. If you're not sure if your idea fits you can ask on our
            <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must load on both a client and server environment. Targeting only the client or server is fine
            as long as loading in an unsupported environment does not crash the game or render the game unplayable.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions are strongly encouraged to be compatible with Minecraft 1.20.1 and the Forge mod loader. While
            supporting other versions and mod loaders is okay, our server and modpack will be targeting that environment
            and we can not include your submission if you do not have a compatible version available for us. We will
            attempt to load Fabric based submissions on Forge using <a href={SINYTRA} target="_blank">Sinytra</a>,
            however this is an experimental project and results are not guaranteed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Third party dependencies such as libraries, frameworks, and APIs can be used within reason. You will be
            accountable for any issues caused by dependencies required by your submission. Dependencies that interfere
            with other submissions or overhaul the game to the point where other submissions are unplayable will be
            excluded from the mod pack and server.
        </li>

        <li>
            Teams are allowed, and even encouraged! There are no limits to the size of teams and a participant may
            participate with multiple teams. Teams are responsible for deciding how prizes won by their submission will
            be distributed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must not contain malicious code or act in bad faith. We expect everyone to be professional and
            try not to ruin the event for anyone else. Intentionally crashing the game, making the game unplayable, or
            maliciously tampering with other submissions will not be accepted.
        </li>

        <li>
            Sponsors of the event and anyone that is employed by a sponsor may participate in the event however they
            will be ineligible to win any prizes beyond those given out to all participants. Teams these individuals are
            on will also be ineligible to win prizes that are not given out to all participants.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must be uploaded to CurseForge before the submission deadline. They must also pass through
            CurseForge's standard review process. We highly encourage uploading your project as soon as possible to
            ensure your project is reviewed in time.
        </li>

        <li>
            Be respectful to other participants, event sponsors, and event organizers.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="prizes">Prizes & Rewards</h2>

    <p>
        This year we will be working with CurseForge to send limited edition prizes to participants of the event. More
        details about these prizes will be revealed closer to the end of the event. To receive the prize your submission
        must follow all rules of the event. Prizes are limited to one per person. We will also be screening submissions
        to check for abuse.
    </p>

    <h2 id="modpack-server">Modpack & Server</h2>
    <p>
        Each year we put together a modpack that showcases mods participating in the event. We also host a public server
        for players to explore these mods together! More information about the modpack and server will be released near
        the end of October.
    </p>

    <h2 id="faq">FaQ</h2>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit multiple entries?">
        Yes you may submit as many entries as you would like however we will not be accepting spam entries. If you do
        choose to work on multiple entries please take steps to avoid stress and burnout.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I join multiple teams?">
        Yes you may join as many teams as you would like. We strongly recommend being transparent with your team mates
        if you choose to do this.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I support multiple mod loaders?">
        Yes you may support as many loaders as you want. Please keep in mind that supporting Minecraft 1.20.1 and the
        Forge mod loader is highly encouraged as this is what our mod pack and server will be using. If you are still
        interested in supporting multiple platforms we recommend checking out the
        <a href={MULTILOADER} target="_blank">MultiLoader Template</a>.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="I am not a mod dev, can I still participate?">
        Absolutely! Everyone is welcome to participate in SpookyJam. One of the easiest ways to participate is by giving
        participants feedback and encouragement. Playing with the submissions, sharing them with your friends, and
        including them in your own mod packs is a great way to support the participants. If you're looking to get more
        directly involved you may be able to contribute to another submission. SpookyJam is also a great opportunity to
        learn more about mod development and try to make your own mod!
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a mod from a previous year?">
        Yes we allow entries from previous years to be resubmitted. Please keep in mind that these entries are not
        eligible for prizes and will not receive the same amount of promotion as new submissions. We will consider them
        in our mod pack and server though.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Does accepting a pull request from an ineligible person make my project ineligible?">
        Accepting minor pull requests from an ineligible person such as an event organizer is fine. Examples of a minor
        pull request include fixing a bug, fixing a typo, optimizing resources, localizing the mod to another language.
        If you are still unsure you can always reach out to an event organizer on <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a>.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Is publishing to CurseForge required to participate?">
        Yes all submission must be published to CurseForge. This requirement allows us to streamline the process of
        building and publishing the mod pack. You may publish to any other platforms in addition to CurseForge.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I use a tool like MCreator?">
        Using tools like MCreator is allowed but not recommended. Participants are responsible for any bugs or issues
        caused by their submission and MCreator is known to produce a higher volume of these issues.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a mod I did not create?">
        No. Only the original author may submit a mod.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="How should teams submit their projects?">
        Teams should select one team member to represent and submit their project. Submitting the same project multiple
        times is not needed and will only create more work for our team.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Do I need to submit my project?">
        Yes you must submit your project within the submission window of the event. We can not find or track your
        submission without this.
    </InfoBox>
