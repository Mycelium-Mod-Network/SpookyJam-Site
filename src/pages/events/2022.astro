    <h2>Announcement</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone o/</p>

    <p>
        We are happy to announce the sixth annual SpookyJam! During October we
        celebrate the fall season and the modded Minecraft community by hosting
        a mod jam. During the jam participants create new mods that fit with the
        fall season and are encouraged to collaborate, learn new skills, and
        challenge themselves. Most importantly we hope that everyone will have
        fun. In addition to the mod jam we also host public servers where anyone
        can join and test out submissions with the community.
    </p>

    <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
    <p>
        We have put the following rules in place to ensure a safe and fair
        experience for all participants. Violating these rules may result in
        your project being disqualified. If you have any questions about the
        rules please reach out on <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a>.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Submissions must only be developed from October 1st to October 31st
            UTC. Coming up with ideas in advance is fine but all code, textures,
            sounds, models, animations, and assets must be made during this time
            frame.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must fit within the broader themes of SpookyJam. These
            themes include anything that is spooky, dark, or mysterious.
            Anything that fits with the fall/autumn season or fits within a
            seasonally relevant custom or tradition is also allowed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must load on a client and dedicated server without
            crashing the game. Targeting only one of these environments is fine
            as long as loading in an unsupported environment does not crash the
            game or cause the game to be unplayable.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must be compatible with Minecraft 1.19.2 and run on
            Forge, Fabric, or Quilt. Supporting all loaders is not required. Our
            servers will be running Forge and Quilt so Fabric authors should
            avoid using code that may break Quilt compatibility.
        </li>

        <li>
            Third party dependencies such as libraries, frameworks, and APIs can
            be used within reason. You will be accountable for any issues caused
            by dependencies required by your project. You must disclose all
            required third party dependencies when submitting your entry.
        </li>

        <li>
            Teams are allowed. There are no limits to the size of a team and
            participants may choose to contribute to multiple teams. Teams will
            be responsible for distributing any prizes won by their projects
            amongst their team members. We recommend at most 4 people per team.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must not contain malicious code or act in bad faith. We
            expect everyone to be professional and intentionally crashing the
            game, making the game unplayable, or maliciously tampering with
            other submissions will not be accepted.
        </li>

        <li>
            Event organizers and those who are employed by sponsors may
            participate in the event however they will not be eligible to win
            prizes. Any team these individuals are on will also be ineligible to
            win prizes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Submissions must be uploaded to CurseForge before the submission
            deadline. They must also pass CurseForge's standard project review.
            We highly encourage uploading your project as soon as possible as
            the review process can take some time to complete and may be
            delayed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="prizes">Prizes & Rewards</h2>
    <p>
        We will be awarding ten cash prizes of $100 to eligible submissions.
        These prizes will be awarded based on special criteria and will be
        determined by a panel of judges and community vote. All participants can
        also claim a limited edition CurseForge T-Shirt and a commemorative role
        on our Discord. The prize pool for this event was generously sponsored
        by CurseForge.
    </p>

    <h3>Prize Categories</h3>
    <p>
        We will be awarding ten $100 prizes based on the specific prize
        categories listed below. These categories are subjective and will be
        determined by combining scores from a community vote with scores from a
        panel of judges comprised of event organizers and sponsors. The scores
        from each will be weighted 50/50. Submissions will also be allowed to
        win in multiple categories. These cash prizes will be awarded through

        cards or PayPal.

        >. A Fabric version of the pack will soon be available.
    </p>

    <h2 id="faq">FaQ</h2>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit multiple entries?">
        Yes, submitting multiple entries is allowed however we will not accept
        spam entries. If you choose to work on multiple entries please take
        steps to avoid stress and burnout.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I join multiple teams?">
        Yes, you may join as many teams as you would like. We recommend being
        transparent with your team mates if you choose to do this.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I support multiple mod loaders?">
        Yes, you may support multiple loaders. We only require that your
        submission support Forge, Fabric, or Quilt. Supporting more than one is
        completely optional and may cause unneeded stress. If you are still
        interested we recommend checking out the <a
            href="https://github.com/Darkhax-Forked/MultiLoader-Template"
            target="_blank">MultiLoader Template</a
        >.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="I am not a mod dev, how can I participate?">
        Everyone is welcome to participate in SpookyJam. One of the easiest ways
        to join in is by giving participants feedback and encouragement. Playing
        with the submissions and sharing them with your friends is a great way
        to spread the word. If you're looking to get involved in a more direct
        way you may be able to help translate submissions to other languages,
        contribute models or textures, or find another way to help. SpookyJam is
        also a great opportunity to learn more about mod development and try to
        make your own mod.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a mod from a previous year?">
        Yes, we allow entries from previous years to be resubmitted. These
        entries are not eligible for prizes and will not receive the same amount
        of promotion that a new submission receives. They will be considered for
        inclusion in the modpack and public server.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox
        title="Does accepting a pull request from an ineligible person make my project ineligible?"
    >
        Accepting minor pull requests from an ineligible person such as an event
        sponsor is fine. Minor pull requests would include fixing bugs, typos,
        resource optimizations, or even localizing the project to another
        language.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="How will projects be judged for prizes?">
        Projects will be judged using a combination of community voting and a
        panel of judges. Each will account for 50% of the final results. Certain
        categories such as community pick will only be decided using community
        vote, while CurseForge's pick will only be decided using their judges.
        More details will be shared closer to the voting period.
    </InfoBox>
    <InfoBox title="Does the mod need to be published on CurseForge?">
        Yes, publishing your mod to CurseForge is a requirement of this event.
        This requirement allows us to streamline the process of publishing our
        modpack and having players connect to the server. We do not require that
        the project is exclusively published to CurseForge.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I use a tool like MCreator?">
        Using tools like MCreator is allowed but not recommended. Participants
        are responsible for any bugs or issues caused by their mod, and MCreator
        is known to produce a higher volume of these issues.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a mod I did not create?">
        No, we only accept submissions from authors of the project in question.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="How should teams submit their projects?">
        Teams should select one team member to submit their project. Submitting
        the same project multiple times is not needed and will only create more
        work for our team.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Do I need to submit my project?">
        Yes, you must submit your project to us within the submission window. We
        can't find or track your project without this.
    </InfoBox>
