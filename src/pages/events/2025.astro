<Layout title="SpookyJam 2025"
        description="Celebrate the fall season with the modded Minecraft community! SpookyJam 2025 will be taking place October 1st to October 31st!">

    <p>
        There's a chill in the air, the leaves are turning, and the shadows stretch just a little too long... You know
        what that means, SpookyJam has returned!
    </p>

    <p>
        From <strong>October 1st</strong> to <strong>October 31st</strong>, we gather once again to celebrate the season
        with a month of creativity and collaboration! Whether you're here to build haunted houses, design eerie mobs,
        forge mysterious items, or bring a touch of autumnal magic to the game, SpookyJam is your chance to make
        something that will send shivers down players spines!
    </p>

    <p>
        SpookyJam is open to modders of all skill levels. If you've never made a mod before, now may be the perfect time
        to learn how! Many teams are looking for help with ideas, textures, sounds, and localization! Join our
        <a href={DISCORD} target="_blank">Discord</a> for more info.

        <ol>
            <li>
                You must submit a working Minecraft Java mod by the end of the month. Our server and modpack will use
                <strong>NeoForge 1.21.1</strong> but they are not required.
            </li>

            <li>
                Your submission must be developed during October 2025. The event follows the UTC timezone.
            </li>

            <li>
                The theme of SpookyJam is anything that is spooky, dark, mysterious, or autumnal.
            </li>

            <li>
                Third party dependencies may be used within reason. You may also use 3rd party assets provided that they

            <li>
                Teams are allowed, and are encouraged! There are no team size limits but we recommend a maximum of four.
                Teams will be responsible for deciding how any prizes won by their submission will be split.
            </li>

            <li>
                Submissions must not contain malicious code or act in bad faith. We expect everyone to be professional
                and try not to ruin the event for anyone else. Intentionally crashing the game, making the game
                unplayable, or maliciously tampering with other submissions will not be allowed.
            </li>

            <li>
                Submissions must be uploaded to CurseForge before the submission deadline. They must also pass through
                CurseForge's standard review process. We highly encourage uploading your project as soon as possible to
                ensure your project is reviewed in time.
            </li>

            <li>
                Be respectful to other participants, event sponsors, and event organizers.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h2 id="faq">FaQ</h2>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit multiple entries?">
        Yes, submitting multiple entries is allowed. If you choose to work on multiple entries please take steps to
        avoid stress and burnout.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I join multiple teams?">
        Yes, however we strongly recommend being transparent with your teammates about this.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I support multiple mod loaders?">
        Yes, you can use any mod loader you wish. We will use <strong>NeoForge 1.21.1</strong> for our server, but it is
        not required to participate.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I use a tool like MCreator?">
        Yes, tools like MCreator are fine.
    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a data pack or resource pack?">

    </InfoBox>

    <InfoBox title="Can I submit a mod from a previous year?">
        Submissions from previous SpookyJam events may be included in our mod pack and server. These submissions are not
